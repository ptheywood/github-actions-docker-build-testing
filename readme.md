# GitHub ACtions Docker Build Testing

Testing building docker containers for x86_64 and aarch64 in hosted github actions, to see if this is viable or not for producing x86_64 containers or not.

I expect there will be memory and/or disk storage issues for building non-trivial containers.

## Building locally

```bash
docker build .
```
